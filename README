This is a silly little conceptual game I originally created for the 'Introduction to Programming' course at Media Technology at Leiden University in 2011-2012

I created the physics of the hearts with a particle system based on the Processing vector tutorial found at https://www.processing.org/tutorials/pvector/

To run the code, install Processing 3, copy files into your Processing sketch folder, and press run.  

Made with Processing (www.processing.org).
